 * Program description: 
 *      This program controls the operation of the 
 *      player in the sample 2D Space Shooter game.
 * 
 * How to use the script:
 *      - Create the Player object
 *      - Setup the necessary sprite inside the Player object
 *      - Make sure that the Player object has a Circle Collider 2D component
 *      - Attach the script to the Player object
