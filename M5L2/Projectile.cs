 *      This program implements the operation of the 
 *      Player's projectile.
 * 
 * How to use the script:
 *      - Create a projectile object
 *      - Setup the necessary projectile sprite
 *      - Make sure that the projectile has a Collider component
 *      - Attach the script to the projectile object
