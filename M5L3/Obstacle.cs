 * Program description: 
 *      This program handles the collision between
 *      the obstacle game object and the Player, but 
 *      this time, updated for the game to produce 
 *      an animation and effect (visual and sound) 
 *      when the obstacle hits the Player.
 *      
 *      Also, the program randomizes the size and 
 *      rotation of the obstacle to make the game 
 *      more challenging.
 * 
 * How to use the script:
 *      - Attach the script to the obstacle object
 *      - Assign the player explosion effect asset to the 
 *          playerExplosionEffect field in the Inspector
