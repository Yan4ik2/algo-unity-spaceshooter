 * Program description: 
 *      This program implements the operation of the 
 *      Player's projectile, but this time, updated 
 *      for the game to produce an animation and 
 *      effect (visual and sound) when the obstacle 
 *      is destroyed.
 * 
 * How to use the script:
 *      - Create a projectile object
 *      - Setup the necessary projectile sprite
 *      - Make sure that the projectile has a Collider component
 *      - Attach the script to the projectile object
 *      - Assign the asteroid explosion effect asset to the 
 *          explosionEffect field in the Inspector
